### Diffing and Patching Tools 

- [GNU Diffutils](http://www.gnu.org/software/diffutils/) - an open source (GPLv3+) package which provides `diff` and other programs.
- [GNU patch](http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/patch/) - apply a patch/diff file. Open source (GPLv3+).
- [patchutils](http://cyberelk.net/tim/software/patchutils/) - Patchutils is a small collection of programs that operate on patch files. Open source.
- [comm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comm) - a UNIX command used to compare two files for common and distinct lines.
- [Meld](http://meldmerge.org/) - a GUI diff/merge tool for gtk+. Open source.
- [KDiff3](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/) - a GUI diff/merge tool for KDE. Open source.
- [GNU wdiff](http://www.gnu.org/software/wdiff/) - a front-end to GNU diff for comparing files on a word-per-word basi

### *<u>Standard UNIX Text Processing Tools</u>* 

- [echo](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_%28command%29) - output strings (with some possible transformations).
- [cat](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_%28Unix%29) - output or concatenate files.
- [cut](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cut_%28Unix%29) - extract sections from each line of output.
- [head](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Head_%28Unix%29) - start of stream.
- [tail](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail_%28Unix%29) - end of stream.
- [paste](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paste_%28Unix%29) - join multiple files horizontally.
- [sort](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sort_%28Unix%29) - sorts input.
- [csplit](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Csplit) - split files based on context lines.
- [join](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Join_%28Unix%29) - merges lines of two files based on commonalities.
- [uniq](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniq) - collapses adjacent lines, and makes the output unique.
- [grep](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep) - search for lines matching regular expressions.
- [sed](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed) - stream editor - a mini programming language for text processing, based on the [ed text editor](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ed_%28text_editor%29).
- [AWK](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AWK) - an even more full-fledged programming language for text processing in UNIX (with some quirks, and idiosyncrasi
